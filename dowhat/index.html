		For this assignment, I created a set of instructions which was given to another student to see if she got the same results I did.
		</h1>
		<p>Instructions:
		<br>
		Fold a regular A4 paper in half horizontally. Following the crease created, draw a straight line with a pencil. Over the line, draw 10 dots 
		<br>
		with equal distance between each other. Starting from the first dot and stretching upwards, draw zig-zag lines all the way through the dots. Then,
		<br>
		draw another zig-zag lines through the dots starting from the first dot and stretching downwards. Then, color in the triangles created between 
		<br>
		intersections of the two zig-zag lines.
		<br>
		<br>
		Results:
		<br>
		My partner followed my instructions very well and ended up with the same results as mine. I wanted to see my partner follow my instructions
		<br>
		and end up with the exact results I had; therefore I made my instructions very straight forward and clear. I was satisfied with the outcome of this 
		<br>
		excersise.
